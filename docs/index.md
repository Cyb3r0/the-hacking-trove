## The Hacking Tool Trove ðŸ‘‘ðŸŒ´:parrot:

This website can definitely help you during your penetration test,
technical security audit, PWK/OSCP Lab or exam, CTF, challenge, training, etc.
by providing tools cheat sheets, tools command examples, tools references, etc.

The idea is to not reinvent the wheel with a nth cheat sheet hacking wiki, there is
already:

- [PayloadsAllTheThings](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings) for **payloads**
- [HackTricks](https://github.com/carlospolop/hacktricks) for **cheat sheets** (methodologies, targeting a port/service/protocol)
- [Rawsec Inventory](https://inventory.raw.pm/) to find **tools** and **resources**
- [Exploit-DB](https://www.exploit-db.com/), [Packet Storm](https://packetstormsecurity.com/), [cxsecurity](https://cxsecurity.com/) for **exploits**
- [AttackerKB](https://attackerkb.com/) for CVE reviews
- etc.

So **THTT** (The Hacking Tool Trove) will focus on providing TL;DR manual pages
and reviews for hacking tools.

:white_check_mark: What THTT **will** help you do:

- Find examples of command for hacking tools
- Find resources associated with a hacking tool
- Find hacking tools associated with a keyword (eg. ssh, smb, java)

:x: What THTT **will NOT** help you do:

- Find payloads
- Find methodologies to hack `XYZ` port, service or protocol
- **Efficiently** find hacking tools (use [Rawsec Inventory](https://inventory.raw.pm/)) instead
- Find exploits
- Find tutorials
